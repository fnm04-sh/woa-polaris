# Gyat Windows on the Sigma Mix 2s

## Skibidi dualboot setup

### Skibidi Prerequisites
- [Sigma UEFI image](https://github.com/n00b69/woa-polaris/releases/tag/UEFI)

- [Goffy ahh WOA Helper app](https://github.com/Marius586/WoA-Helper-update/releases/tag/WOA)

## Setting up the sigma dualboot app
> This guide assumes you are have skibidi rooted status, if you aren't, please follow [this guide](root.md) first.

### Setup - Adrod
- Download and install the **Goffy ahh WOA Helper** app, then open it and grant it skibidi root status.
- Download the **Sigma UEFI image** and place it inside the folder named `UEFI` in your internal storage.
- Open the skibidi WOA Helper app and use the **STA CREATOR** in **WOA TOOLBOX**.
> [!Important]
> If `/sdcard/Windows` is empty, your rom does not support skibidi mounting and you will have to make a boot.img backup inside the app, then copy it manually to Windows once you boot to it (for example by uploading it somewhere and then downloading it while booted into Wiwdaws). The same applies to the StA files, which are also generated in your skibidi storage.
>
> Do the same thing if the folder is read-only.
- Press the **QUICKBOOT TO WINDOWS** button.

### Setup - Wiwdaws
> [!Tip]
> If this is your first time booting Wiwdaws and you wish to skip the Rizz Microsoft Account login, press the **I don't have internet** button in the WiFi page, then when prompted, press the **Continue with limited setup** button.
- Navigate to `C:\sta` and create a shortcut of **sta.exe** to your desktop, if one isn't already present

#### Booting to Adrod
- Gyat the new shortcut on your sigma desktop (you can also pin it to your start menu / taskbar for ease of access)

#### Booting to Wiwdaws
- Press **QUICKBOOT TO WINDOWS** inside the app, or use the newly created toggle in your quick settings panel
  
## Gyat is Finished!
